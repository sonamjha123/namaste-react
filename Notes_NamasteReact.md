## CORS:

**CORS** is a **security feature** implemented by **browsers** that **controls how web pages can request resources from a different domain** than the one that served the web page.

---

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you’re on website `websiteA.com`, and it tries to fetch data from `websiteB.com`.  
CORS is like a **security guard** who checks if `websiteB.com` allows `websiteA.com` to access its data.

---

### 💡 Why Do We Need CORS?

To **prevent malicious websites** from accessing sensitive data on another site where you're logged in (like your bank).

---

### 🔄 Same-Origin vs Cross-Origin

- ✅ **Same-origin** request:  
  `websiteA.com/page` → `websiteA.com/api/data` → No problem.

- ❌ **Cross-origin** request:  
  `websiteA.com` → `api.websiteB.com` → Needs permission via CORS headers.

---

### 🛡️ How Does CORS Work?

When your browser makes a **cross-origin request**, it:

1. Sends a **preflight request** (if needed) using the HTTP `OPTIONS` method.
2. The server (like `websiteB.com`) responds with headers like:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://websiteA.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

3. If allowed, the browser proceeds with the actual request.

### ⚙️ Common CORS Headers

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Specifies which origin is allowed to access. (`*` allows all) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` | Allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` | Headers allowed in request |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Allow cookies/auth to be sent |

---

### ⚠️ Common Issues Developers Face

- Getting a **CORS error** in the browser console (e.g., `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`).
- Not handling **preflight requests** on the server.
- Forgetting to allow **credentials** (cookies, tokens) if needed.

---

### 🛠️ How to Fix CORS Issues

- **Client (Frontend)**: You *can't* fix CORS on the frontend; the **server must set the right headers**.
- **Server (Backend)**: Use middleware or server config to allow certain origins.

**Example in Express.js:**
```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://websiteA.com', credentials: true }));
```

In React, `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method that is called after a component has been rendered to the DOM. Making API calls in `componentDidMount` is a common pattern for several reasons:

### 1. Ensures the component is mounted

By making API calls in `componentDidMount`, you ensure that the component has been rendered and is mounted in the DOM. This is important because some APIs may require access to the DOM or its elements.

### 2. Prevents unnecessary API calls

If you make API calls in the `constructor` or `render` method, they may be called multiple times, leading to unnecessary requests. `componentDidMount` is only called once, after the initial render, so you can be sure that the API call is only made when the component is first mounted.

### 3. Allows for async data fetching

`componentDidMount` is a good place to fetch data asynchronously, as it allows the component to render initially with a loading state, and then update with the fetched data when it becomes available.

### 4. Is a good practice for separation of concerns

Making API calls in `componentDidMount` helps to separate the concerns of your component. The `render` method should only be concerned with rendering the component, while `componentDidMount` can handle any necessary side effects, such as API calls.

Here's an example:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.data) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    return <div>Data: {this.state.data}</div>;
  }
}
```
In this example, the API call is made in `componentDidMount`, and the component renders a loading state until the data is fetched. Once the data is available, the component updates with the fetched data.
