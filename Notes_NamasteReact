## CORS:

**CORS** is a **security feature** implemented by **browsers** that **controls how web pages can request resources from a different domain** than the one that served the web page.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you‚Äôre on website `websiteA.com`, and it tries to fetch data from `websiteB.com`.  
CORS is like a **security guard** who checks if `websiteB.com` allows `websiteA.com` to access its data.

---

### üí° Why Do We Need CORS?

To **prevent malicious websites** from accessing sensitive data on another site where you're logged in (like your bank).

---

### üîÑ Same-Origin vs Cross-Origin

- ‚úÖ **Same-origin** request:  
  `websiteA.com/page` ‚Üí `websiteA.com/api/data` ‚Üí No problem.

- ‚ùå **Cross-origin** request:  
  `websiteA.com` ‚Üí `api.websiteB.com` ‚Üí Needs permission via CORS headers.

### üõ°Ô∏è How Does CORS Work?

When your browser makes a **cross-origin request**, it:

1. Sends a **preflight request** (if needed) using the HTTP `OPTIONS` method.
2. The server (like `websiteB.com`) responds with headers like:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://websiteA.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

3. If allowed, the browser proceeds with the actual request.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common CORS Headers

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Specifies which origin is allowed to access. (`*` allows all) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` | Allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` | Headers allowed in request |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Allow cookies/auth to be sent |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues Developers Face

- Getting a **CORS error** in the browser console (e.g., `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`).
- Not handling **preflight requests** on the server.
- Forgetting to allow **credentials** (cookies, tokens) if needed.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix CORS Issues

- **Client (Frontend)**: You *can't* fix CORS on the frontend; the **server must set the right headers**.
- **Server (Backend)**: Use middleware or server config to allow certain origins.

**Example in Express.js:**
```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://websiteA.com', credentials: true }));
```
